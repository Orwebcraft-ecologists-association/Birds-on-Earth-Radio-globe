Birds-on-Earth-Radio-globe
Explore the real-time soundscape of our planet's birds with this interactive 3D globe. Tune into live audio streams of birdsong from various locations worldwide and experience the beauty of avian biodiversity.

üåç Project Purpose
The Birds-on-Earth-Radio-globe project aims to connect people with the natural world in a unique and immersive way. By visualizing real-time bird sounds on an interactive globe, we want to:

Raise Awareness: Highlight the incredible diversity of bird species and their habitats around the globe.

Promote Conservation: Encourage interest in avian conservation by showcasing the beauty and fragility of our planet's soundscapes.

Educate and Inspire: Provide an educational tool for bird enthusiasts, students, and researchers to explore and learn about different bird calls and their geographical distribution.

Create a Relaxing Experience: Offer a soothing and meditative experience, allowing users to listen to the calming sounds of nature from the comfort of their homes.

‚ú® Key Features
Interactive 3D Globe: A fully interactive globe that users can rotate, zoom, and explore.

Real-time Audio Streams: Live audio streams from various locations, capturing the ambient sounds of birds in their natural habitats.

Bird Sound Identification: An integrated feature that attempts to identify the species of birds being heard in the audio streams.

Location-based Filtering: The ability to filter audio streams by continent, country, or specific ecosystem.

Day/Night Cycle: A visual representation of the day and night cycle on the globe, which influences the types of bird sounds you hear.

User Contributions: A system for users to submit their own bird sound recordings from their local areas.

üéØ Target Audience
This project is for anyone with an interest in nature, technology, and the world around them. This includes:

Nature Lovers and Birdwatchers: Individuals who are passionate about birds and want to explore their sounds from different parts of the world.

Educators and Students: A great tool for teachers to use in the classroom to teach about geography, biology, and environmental science.

Researchers and Ornithologists: A potential source of data for studying bird vocalizations and migration patterns.

Developers and Tech Enthusiasts: A fun and engaging project for those interested in web development, data visualization, and real-time applications.

Anyone seeking a moment of calm: A perfect way to relax and de-stress by listening to the soothing sounds of nature.

üíª Technologies Used
The project is built using a modern and scalable tech stack:

Frontend:

React / Vue.js / Svelte: A modern JavaScript framework for building the user interface.

Three.js / Deck.gl: A 3D graphics library for creating the interactive globe.
